## Graduate School Application Guide

With the intention of helping younger students in the Dean's Scholars Honors Program who were hoping to apply to graduate school after finishing their undergraduate degrees, my friend [Griffin Glenn](http://griffindglenn.github.io/) and I wrote a [**guide to graduate school applications!**](files/resource-grad_app_guide.pdf) It contains:

* A timeline beginning in the first year of undergrad
* An overview of the application and interview/visit process
* A summary of the application materials

We aimed to share what we wish we knew before we began the application process; we hope it serves you well!



## Faith & Science Resources

I spent much of my undergraduate career unaware of organizations seeking both to harmonize faith and science and to provide community for scientists who are also people of faith. Here are a few of the organizations and resources I wish I had learned of earlier:

* [BioLogos](https://biologos.org/): Founded by Dr. Francis Collins, the former leader of the Human Genome Project and  current NIH director, Biologos invites the church and the world to see the harmony between science and biblical faith by presenting an evolutionary understanding of God’s creation. I also recommend Dr. Collins' book [*The Language of God*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Language_of_God) and the BioLogos [podcast](https://biologos.org/podcast/language-of-god) by the same name.
* [The American Scientific Affiliation](https://network.asa3.org/default.aspx): The ASA is an international network of Christians in the sciences. They publish a journal on science and faith, host conferences, and have chapters all over the world.
* [The Emerging Scholars Network](https://blog.emergingscholars.org/about/): The ESN is a national network within [InterVarsity’s Graduate & Faculty Ministries](https://gfm.intervarsity.org/) which supports those on the academic pathway as they work out how their academic vocation serves God and others. In July 2020 I attended a virtual conference jointly hosted by ESN and ASA--it was a great opportunity to discuss science, faith, and career with other young scientists!
